Today, let’s understand them briefly and how they are used.

# **1) KS Plot:**

  * It is used to assess the distributional differences.
  * The idea is to measure the maximum distance between the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of two distributions.
  * The lower the maximum distance, the more likely they belong to the same distribution.

# **2) SHAP Plot:**

---  
  
  * It summarizes feature importance to a model’s predictions by considering interactions/dependencies between them.
  * It is useful in determining how different values (low or high) of a feature affect the overall output.
  * We covered model interpretability extensively in our 3-part crash course.

# **3) ROC Curve:**

---  
  
  * It depicts the tradeoff between the true positive rate (good performance) and the false positive rate (bad performance) across different classification thresholds.
  * The idea is to balance TPR (good performance) vs. FPR (bad performance).

# **4) Precision-Recall Curve:**

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe1827901-140d-440e-ad1a-399bfab36e0f_1448x676.png)   
---  
  
  * It depicts the tradeoff between Precision and Recall across different classification thresholds.

# **5) QQ Plot:**

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0725182f-9dbd-41ca-880e-7d789abc8bc5_1272x704.png)   
---  
  
  * It assesses the distributional similarity between observed data and theoretical distribution.
  * It plots the quantiles of the two distributions against each other.
  * Deviations from the straight line indicate a departure from the assumed distribution.

#  **6) Cumulative Explained Variance Plot** :

---  
  
  * It is useful in determining the number of dimensions we can reduce our data to while preserving max variance during PCA.

# **7) Elbow Curve:**

---  
  
  * The plot helps identify the optimal number of clusters for the k-means algorithm.
  * The point of the elbow depicts the ideal number of clusters.

# **8) Silhouette Curve:**

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd0676d3-17cc-40eb-8928-b3f0a8f931f2_1456x1380.png)   
---  
  
  * The Elbow curve is often ineffective when you have plenty of clusters.
  * Silhouette Curve is a better alternative, as depicted above.

# **9) Gini-Impurity and Entropy:**

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc1dd132d-25f8-4091-854d-2d5eb6e5381d_1308x676.png)   
---  
  
  * They are used to measure the impurity or disorder of a node or split in a decision tree.
  * The plot compares Gini impurity and Entropy across different splits.
  * This provides insights into the tradeoff between these measures.

#  **10) Bias-Variance Tradeoff** :

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc0437d11-f1b1-4ef2-ac24-05522e472593_1496x676.png)   
---  
  
  * It’s probably the most popular plot on this list.
  * It is used to find the right balance between the bias and the variance of a model against complexity.

# **11) Partial Dependency Plots:**

  * Depicts the dependence between target and features.
  * A plot between the target and one feature forms → 1-way PDP.
  * A plot between the target and two feature forms → 2-way PDP.
  * In the leftmost plot, an increase in temperature generally results in a higher target value.
  * We covered model interpretability extensively in our 3-part crash course.
