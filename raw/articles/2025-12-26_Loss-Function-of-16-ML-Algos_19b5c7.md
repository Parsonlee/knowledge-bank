Since loss functions are a vital component of ML algorithms, knowing which loss functions are (typically) best suited for specific ML algorithms is extremely crucial.

**1) Linear Regression:** Mean squared error (MSE). This can be used with and without regularization, depending on the situation.

**2) Logistic regression:** Cross-entropy loss or Log Loss, with and without regularization.

  * Why log loss? We covered its origin here: [**Why Do We Use log-loss to Train Logistic Regression?**](<https://www.dailydoseofds.com/why-do-we-use-log-loss-to-train-logistic-regression/>)
  * Also, do you know Logistic regression can be trained without specifying a learning rate? We covered it here: [**Why Sklearn’s Logistic Regression Has No Learning Rate Hyperparameter?**](<https://www.dailydoseofds.com/why-sklearns-logistic-regression-has-no-learning-rate-hyperparameter/>)

**3) Decision Tree and Random Forest:**

  * Classification: Gini impurity or information gain.
  * Regressor: Mean squared error (MSE).

**4) Support Vector Machines (SVMs):** Hinge loss. It penalizes both wrong and right (but less confident) predictions. Best suited for creating max-margin classifiers, like in SVMs.

**5) k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN):** No loss function. kNN is a non-parametric lazy learning algorithm. It works by retrieving instances from the training data, and making predictions based on the k nearest neighbors to the test data instance.

**6) Naive Bayes:** No loss function. Can you answer why?

**7) Neural Networks:** They can use a variety of loss functions depending on the type of problem. The most common ones are:

  * Regression: Mean squared error (MSE).
  * Classification: Cross-Entropy Loss.

**8) AdaBoost:** Exponential loss function. AdaBoost is an ensemble learning algorithm. It combines multiple weak classifiers to form a strong classifier. In each iteration of the algorithm, AdaBoost assigns weights to the misclassified instances from the previous iteration. Next, it trains a new weak classifier and minimizes the weighted exponential loss.

**9) Other Boosting Algorithms:**

  * Regression: Mean squared error (MSE).
  * Classification: Cross-Entropy Loss.
