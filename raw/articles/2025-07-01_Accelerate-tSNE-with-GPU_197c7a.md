## **Accelerate tSNE with GPU**

The run-time of t-SNE is quadratically related to the number of data points.

Thus, it becomes difficult to use t-SNE from Sklearn implementations when your data has over 40k+ data points.

tSNE-CUDA is an optimized CUDA version of the tSNE algorithm. Thus, it provides immense speedups over the standard Sklearn implementation:

As depicted above, the GPU-accelerated implementation is 33 times faster than the Sklearn implementation.

That said, this implementation only supports `n_components=2`, i.e., you can only project to two dimensions.

The authors do not intend to support more dimensions since this will require significant changes to the code.

But in my opinion, the support for more dimensions doesn’t matter because tSNE is used to generate 2D projections in 99% of the use cases.

These are the benchmarking results by the authors:

It depicts that on the CIFAR-10 training set (50k images), tSNE-CUDA is 700x Faster than Sklearn.
