## **Double Descent vs. Bias-Variance Trade-off**

It is well-known that as the number of model parameters increases, the model gradually overfits the data.

For instance, consider fitting a polynomial regression model trained on this dummy dataset below:

In case you don’t know, this is called a polynomial regression model:

Here, as we’ll increase the degree (`m`):

  * The training loss will get closer to zero.
  * The test (or validation) loss will first decrease and then increase.

This is also evident from the following loss plot:

But notice what happens when you continue increasing the degree (`m`):

Why does the test loss increase to a certain point but then decrease again?

What you see here is called the “double descent phenomenon,” and it is commonly observed in many deep learning models.

It depicts that increasing the model complexity beyond the point of interpolation can improve generalization performance.

And it’s hard to fathom since it challenges the traditional bias-variance trade-off:

To the best of our knowledge, this is still an open question, and it isn’t entirely clear why neural networks exhibit this behavior.

Some theories suggest that the model applies an implicit regularization that allows it to precisely focus on an apt number of parameters for generalization.

You can actually try it yourself:

  * Create a small dummy dataset of size n.
  * Train a polynomial regression of degree m, starting from 1 to a value greater than n.
  * Plot the test loss and training loss for each m.

👉 Over to you: What do you think about the possible causes?
