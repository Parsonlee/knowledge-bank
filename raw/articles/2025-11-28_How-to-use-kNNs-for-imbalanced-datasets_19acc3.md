## [**How to use kNNs for imbalanced datasets**](<https://www.dailydoseofds.com/8-fatal-yet-non-obvious-pitfalls-and-cautionary-measures-in-data-science/>)  
  
kNN is highly sensitive to the parameter `k`.

To understand this, consider this dummy 2D dataset below (the red data point is a test instance we want to generate a prediction for using kNN and k=7):

Generating a prediction will involve:

  1. counting its `7` nearest neighbors
  2. assigning it to the class with the highest count among those 7 neighbors.

The problem with Step 2 is that it is entirely based on class contribution. So the class that maximally contributes to the `k` nearest neighbors is picked.

But this fails when you have imbalanced datasets.

For instance, with `k=7`, the red data point below can NEVER be assigned to the yellow class, no matter how close it is:

There are two ways to address this.

# **Solution #1: Used distance-weighed kNN**

Distance-weighted kNNs are a robust alternative to traditional kNNs, that consider distance to the nearest neighbor for classification.

For instance, below, the green data point gets classified as red with traditional kNN (k=7), despite being closer to the blue cluster:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!KZlp!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9924e4f5-7a87-488a-b255-c9b92bfe591d_1432x654.png)   
---  
  
But the same data point gets classified as blue with distance-weighed kNN:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!89cv!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99785e04-cdce-4ead-a333-d0423794db31_1432x654.png)   
---  
  
That said, it is not the default option in implementations like sklearn, so make sure to enable it:

# **Solution #2: Dynamically update the hyperparameter k**

Recall the above dataset again:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!svLi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffdb2357e-8717-421f-9b50-24dfa43a3b74_1456x708.png)   
---  
  
Here, you may argue that one must refrain from setting the hyperparameter `k` to any value greater than the minimum number of samples across all classes. 

But there’s a problem with it.

Setting a super low value of `k` is usually not ideal in extremely imbalanced datasets:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8ULy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7c2ed832-98fd-4d97-883a-094bb75719f1_1456x592.png)   
---  
  
Setting a globally low value of `k` (say, 1 or 2) leads to suboptimal performance since it does not holistically evaluate the nearest neighbor patterns compared to what a large value of `k` can do.

But we just discussed above that setting a large value of `k`, also leads to the domination problem.

Both problems can be solved by dynamically updating the hyperparameter `k` based on the situation.

More specifically, there are three steps in this approach.

For every test instance:

  1. Set a standard value of `k` as we usually would and find the `k` nearest neighbors.
  2. Next, for all classes that appear in the `k` nearest neighbors, find the total number of training instances they have.

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!wBwj!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1a0214c7-85de-480f-8d02-6e8cd1c1eec9_2840x700.png) Here, we found blue and yellow classes in the 7 nearest neighbors, with a total of 40 and 3 samples respectively.

  1. Update the value of k to:

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PYN9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc70e7336-f577-4644-913c-0ab093c6f94a_347x105.png)   
---  
  
Now perform majority voting only on the first `k’` neighbors only.

Here’s why this makes sense:

  * If a minority class appears in the top `k` nearest neighbor, the update rule will reduce the value of `k` so that the majority class does not dominate.
  * If a minority class DOES NOT appear in the top `k` nearest neighbor, it will likely not update the value of `k` (_because k would be the smallest value during the update process_) and do a holistic classification.

The only shortcoming is that you wouldn’t find this approach in any open-source implementations.
