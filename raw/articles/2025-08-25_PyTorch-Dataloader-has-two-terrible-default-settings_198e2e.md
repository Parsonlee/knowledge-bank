Consider the model training loop in PyTorch shown below:

  * Line 5 transfers the data to the GPU from the CPU.
  * Everything executes on the GPU after the data transfer, i.e., lines 7-15.

This means when the GPU is working, the CPU is idle, and when the CPU is working, the GPU is idle, as depicted below:

Ideally, you can transfer batch 2 when the GPU is training the model on batch 1.

Enabling this is quite simple in PyTorch.

First, define the DataLoader object with `pin_memory=True` and `num_workers`.

Next, during the data transfer step in the training loop, specify `non_blocking=True`:

Done!

Here's the speed comparison on MNIST:

  * Under normal settings, the model takes 43 seconds to train on 5 epochs.

  * But with updated settings, the same model trains in 9 seconds:

Of course, this isn't the only technique to accelerate model training.
