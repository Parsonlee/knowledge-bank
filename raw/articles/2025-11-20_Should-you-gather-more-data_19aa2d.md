## **Should you gather more data?**

At times, no matter how much you try, the model performance barely improves:

  * Feature engineering gives a marginal improvement.
  * Trying different models does not produce satisfactory results either.
  * and more…

This is usually an indicator that we don’t have enough data to work with.

But since gathering new data can be a time-consuming and tedious process...

...here's a technique to determine whether more data will help:

  * Divide the dataset into “k” equal parts. Usually, 7 to 12 parts are fine.
  * Train models cumulatively on the above subsets and measure the performance on the validation set:

  * Train a model on the **first subset** only.
  * Train a model on the **first two subsets** only.
  * And so on…

Plotting the validation performance will produce one of these two lines:

  * Line A conveys that adding more data will likely increase the model's performance.
  * Line B conveys that the model's performance has already saturated. Adding more data will most likely not result in any considerable gains.

This way, you can ascertain whether gathering data will help.
